    Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular CLI") is a
    TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the
    Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
    Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
    Angular is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB
    database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular itself (or
    AngularJS), and Node.js server runtime environment.
